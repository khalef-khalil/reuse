## Smart Contract Structure
```solidity
contract ReuseLabel {
    struct Certificate {
        address issuer;
        address owner;
        string productId;
        uint256 issueDate;
        bool isValid;
    }
    
    mapping(string => Certificate) public certificates;
    
    function issueCertificate(string memory productId) public {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    function verifyCertificate(string memory productId) public view returns (bool) {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    function transferCertificate(string memory productId, address newOwner) public {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```
